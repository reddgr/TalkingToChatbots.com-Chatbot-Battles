# TalkingToChatbots.com Chatbot Battles

## Description
This repository features `cb_battle.py`, a Python script developed with assistance from ChatGPT. The script is a Tkinter GUI application that scores chatbots on various metrics and generates an HTML display of the results. The aim of publishing the code is to showcase how ChatGPT can assist in creating functional code for any real-world application. If you're interested in learning more about chatbot battles, read more at https://reddgr.com/talking-to-chatbots/is-philosophy-a-science-chatbot-battle/ for an introduction to the concept and design.

## Setup
Ensure you have Python installed on your computer to run this script.

1. Download the `cb_battle.py` file from this repository.
2. Run the script in your Python environment:

python cb_battle.py

## Usage
Within the GUI:
1. Fill in the 'Chatbot Battle Title'.
2. Enter each chatbot's name and link.
3. Set scores for Specificity, Coherency, Brevity, and Novelty.

6. Use 'Copy to Clipboard' to copy the generated HTML.
7. Select 'Clear Screen' to clear the output area for a new session.

## Purpose
The project is not just about building a GUI or generating HTML, but rather demonstrating the process of developing software with the aid of conversational AI like ChatGPT. It highlights the interactive development experience and the tangible outputs that can be achieved.

## Future Enhancements
Future updates may include more scripts and examples of ChatGPT-assisted development, reflecting the evolving conversation and content on talkingtochatbots.com.

## Final Note
This README file was written with the assistance of ChatGPT. Happy coding! :)
